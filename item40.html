        <h1>H.U.M.A.N Legacy Bottle </h1>
        
        <p> To celebrate two years since our foundation, we partner up with the amazing illustrator Eduardo Ramon Trejo, to create a series of 3 bottles that we gave to our clients as a gift.

            The entire process of the illustrations and crafting the bottle were made with all the care and attention that our clients deserve. Each of the labels represents crucial parts of the philosophy at the studio. 
            
            The first illustration represents humans and its existence as intelligent and aware beings. Through our intelligence, humans possess the cognitive abilities to learn, understand, apply logic, and reason, including the capacities to comprehend ideas.
            
            The second illustration represents the Humanity's universal and enduring interest in space, driven to explore the unknown, discover new worlds, push the boundaries of our limits, and then push further. 
            
            The third represents the legacy of humans on earth. Our concern on leaving a legacy we can be proud of. 
            Even after we have left our terrenal body, it shall remain.
            
            The bottles were produced under a limited stock, they are printed by hand with manual techniques such as blind emboss and foil to highlight the care we have in every project we undertake. 
            
            We thus seek to leave a legacy in the clients who have worked with us. 
            
            ​​​​​​​Design is our legacy® 
            By H.u.m.a.n® for humans
