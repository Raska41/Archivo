        <h1>Graduation Summary</h1>
        
        <p>The goal of this project was to resume my 5 years at Institut
            Sup√©rieur de Design in a poster. I decided to not show any of 
            products but to tell a story through the different places I have
             been, thanks to my studies.

            The spot represented are places where I worked, visited or used 
            to go with friends.
            Each buildings is similar to the real one, except for the colors 
            and position. The line connecting those are telling different 
            stories that we lived.
        </p>
